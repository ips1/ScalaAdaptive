  * A package containing all the logging functionality of ScalaAdaptive.
  *
  * The [[scalaadaptive.core.logging.Logger]] is the type used throughout the framework for logging. The implementation
  * specified in [[scalaadaptive.core.configuration.Configuration]] can write either to standard output (
  * [[scalaadaptive.core.logging.ConsoleLogger]]), to file ([[scalaadaptive.core.logging.FileLogger]]), or do nothing
  * ([[scalaadaptive.core.logging.EmptyLogger]]).
