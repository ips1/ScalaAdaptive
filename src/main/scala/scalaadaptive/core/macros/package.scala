/**
  * Created by Petr Kubat on 7/17/17.
  *
  * Package with helper classes that are used in macro implementations, mainly for processing ASTs and generating new
  * ones. The core class that is used at compile-time and provides macro support functionality is the
  * [[scalaadaptive.core.macros.AdaptiveMacrosHelper]] class.
  *
  * Macros are used in ScalaAdaptive to extract method names from eta-expansion expressions.
  * More details about this usage can be found in the original thesis text.
